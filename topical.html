                    <p>
                        From an ethical perspective, replacing thousands of jobs with AI long before the welfare system is able to support the people who have been rendered jobless 
                        is terrible. Several people will have to transition from a well-paid job that their education has built up to, into a job that pays a significantly lower amount. 
                        This will inevitably harm both individuals, and families, as well as the people who benefit from certain types of software development, 
                        such as persons with various disabilities.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        An AI program, at the state they are currently in, would code based on the errors made by the humans before them. This could include formal issues with code-legibility, for example. 
                        If we imagine that the code written by the AI is overlooked by a human person after it’s been generated, 
                        it’ll take a lot of additional time for that person to try to interpret what the AI wants to do, since they 
                        tend to generate nonsensical class names, for example. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="topical-bottom-paragraph">
                        In one of our night lectures, Geirbo mentioned how there are several ways of becoming invisible to the system based on circumstances in your life. 
                        We can take a common one as an example; Imagine that you fall outside of the binary gender system. While several web services now allow you to choose 
                        “Other” as your gender, you still cannot be processed as a non-binary individual for passports, for example. The vast majority of code written for 
                        choosing a gender will fall under the type that only uses a binary selection. The algorithm will take this into consideration, and will, 
                        unless it is specifically told to do otherwise, follow the majority.

                    <p>
                    For companies that focus on rapid development, using AI instead of a majority-human workforce can be incredibly tempting. 
                    If a client is in dire need of, let’s say, a website, using AI to code will get you a viable product much faster than you would with a traditional process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    It could also enable single persons without any coding knowledge to see their dream-projects through without having to spend any significant 
                    amount of time learning what is essentially a whole new language category.
                    </p>

                    <p class="topical-bottom-paragraph">
                        AI could allow a future where companies do not need much more than a CEO and a set of AI-supervisors. 
                        These supervisors would be individuals with experience in different fields, like programming and design, 
                        who serve as quality control before the product is shipped to a client. 
                        The time associated with producing new software would reduce significantly, 
                        and you could step around the down-sides of AI by utilizing the AI-supervisors.

                        Generally speaking, AI can be an amazing tool, as long as it’s used to aid genuine persons, rather than used as a replacement for human labor. 
                        Some speak of a labourless future, where AI can free up our time so we can focus on developing creatively and the things that really matter in life, 
                        but we currently have no support systems for the people who will lose their jobs in the early stages of the transition from human labor to AI labor.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        For programmers, AI could be a wonderful way of double checking the code you’ve written yourself, as well as serve as a starting point when you’re stuck, 
                        but the state AI is in currently will not serve as an adequate replacement.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        However, machine learning algorithms and software are getting increasingly more sophisticated. 
                        Many struggled to imagine AI ever getting to the point we’re at now, but the rate at which they have developed is staggering.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="topical-bottom-paragraph">
                        It will be up to the employers to decide whether or not AI should replace their workforce. 
                        Regulations are on their way, but before they are put into place, 
                        we will have to rely on employers’ moral compases to ensure that our jobs are secure, 
                        at least until we have the infrastructure needed to enter a future free of human labor.
