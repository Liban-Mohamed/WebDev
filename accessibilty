				<h2> What have we done to ensure that our website is accessible?</h2>
		
				<p>
					We’ve made sure that all of our text has enough contrast, by using dark text on light backgrounds; 
					We’ve frequently consulted the inspect tool to assure that all of our text is legible. 
					We’ve also used the standard hamburger menu icon so the user does not have to wonder about how to navigate our website.
					When that icon is clicked, it transforms into an X, so there will be no confusion as to how one can exit the menu.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					We’ve also made sure that our website is viewable on all devices, by adding different code for different screen widths with the use of media queries. 
					For most of the pages, that meant removing the grid. Like so:
				</p>

				<p class="aaccesability-content">
					Our images are large, so you’ll have no issues viewing them, no matter what kind of screen you’re currently using, 
					and they all have alt text, with the exception of the hero image on the Index page, to accommodate for individuals with screen readers.
					Some of the text is rather descriptive, while some of it is not, 
					depending on how important the content of the image is to the content on the page.
				</p>

				<p>
					The image described in this alt text, for example, 
					has important information on it that someone with impaired vision cannot see, 
					so the alt text is longer, to ensure that the user can still get a clear idea of what the image says.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our links are black by default, but change colors when you hover. On the Topical page, 
					they also get a box shadow, both to give the page a different visual identity, 
					and to make it crystal clear that clicking on the link will make something happen. 
					We also made the decision to keep the underlines for the links so that they would still look like links, 
					even though we’d changed the default color to black. Only the links have underlines. 
					The logo in the hamburger menu also dims its opacity when you hover, to tell the user that it’s a clickable link.

				<p>
					Sans serif is used as our font type, since it seems like the general consensus is that sans serif is more legible than serif fonts. 
					It also helps the pages look more modern; The default HTML font-face, Times New Roman, might be great for print, 
					but it makes web pages look slightly outdated.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Lastly, we’ve run the LightHouse accessibility test on all of our pages. 
					Our initial test results only got around 93 as the accessibility score, 
					which is a little ironic, especially on the accessibility page. We have, 
					however, improved the scores since, and these were the results:
